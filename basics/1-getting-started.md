# Getting Started

---

## What do you need to get started?

Well first of all, being curious and actually willing to try things out.

In theory you could use anything that even remotely qualifies as a computer, like a [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi#Raspberry_Pi_Zero) with just a Keyboard, Screen (preferably connected via HDMI and ideally internet connection) for it.

However in theory any PC or even disused Thin Client should have ample of horsepower for most tasks.
