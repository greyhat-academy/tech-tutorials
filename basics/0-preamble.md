# Preamble

## Why write this?
### 1. Importance of Education 
It's important to let people know how things work.

Technology isn't magic, but logical, and thus should be made comprehensible.

### 2. Lack of easy entry material
There hasn't been much of such material when I grew up, and thus "Fuck Around and Find Out" was often the only method to learn, which is not optimal.

### 3. Someone has to [start] do it...
...and if I don't then I'll be just [some bearded asshole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman#Controversies) [who can only say "What's bad about X..." but refuses to provide working alternatives](https://stallman.org/).
